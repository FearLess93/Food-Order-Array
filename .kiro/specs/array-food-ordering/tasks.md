# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Array Food Ordering System into discrete, incremental coding tasks. Each task builds upon previous work and includes specific requirements references.

## Notes

- Each task should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- All tasks include specific requirement references for traceability
- Real-time features (Phase 4) depend on core backend features (Phase 3)
- Frontend phases (5-7) can be developed in parallel with backend phases after Phase 3
- Security measures (Phase 8) should be implemented throughout but are consolidated here for review
- All testing tasks are required for production-ready quality
